  Contains all SQL queries used to explore, join, and analyze the COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets.


## Tools Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Tableau Public**

  
##  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **subqueries**, **TEMP Table** and **Create View**

- **Joining large datasets** 
- **Aggregations** and **trend analysis over time**


##  Sample Questions Answered in the Project

- What is the **death rate** per country or continent?
- Which countries had the **highest death percentages**?
- What percentage of the population is **fully vaccinated** over time?
- How do cumulative vaccination numbers grow **month-over-month**?
